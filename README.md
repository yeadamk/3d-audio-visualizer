# 3D Audio Visualizer
*Synesthesia* is an interactive 3D audio visualizer that allows users to immerse themselves in their own music and voice. At the core of the project is a reactive sphere that responds dynamically to audio input (whether music or the userâ€™s voice) by transforming its geometry and producing vivid visual effects.
